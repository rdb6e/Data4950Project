# Data4950Project
Final Project for MTSU DATA 4950 Class

	The True-Blue Times would like to take this time to thank those who were part of this research in finding a new way of ranking colleges. 
	These rankings will hopefully help determine the future of our kids and in which schools they should attend in the future so they can get a great education at a nice school.
	First let’s look at the U.S. News & World Report and how they ranked the schools. 
	They looked at schools in which they were private or not along with the prestigiousness of the school as if they were the top of the top. Along with those ranking were other attributes that included all but not limited to the SAT and ACT scores, Total Annual Cost, Average Grant Aid, etc. 
	These factors all lead to a school’s credibility since those who have a perfect ACT and SAT score will usually be noticed by the like of Harvard and Stanford Universities. 
	These schools expect nothing but the best of the best and only want that from their body causing it to be insanely hard to already get into. 
	However, the rankings have been scrutinized for many years by a lot of people causing many to not even participate in te rankings since they don’t want to be associated with bribing and changing the data to make the schools look nicer than they are. 
	Here at True-Blue times, we’ve come up with a better way to look at the rankings depending on who you are and what you can attend. 
	We’ve decided to get rid of the ACT and SAT scores since many universities don’t report them anyways along with the websites since they are very attainable with a quick engine search. 
	The team wanted to look at ways that were best for just getting into school and the hardest and what they were. The University of Texas, El Paso, was the only school that we researched and had a 100 percent acceptance rate to get into the school. 
	While the likes of Harvard and Stanford both have a 5 percent chance of even getting into the school. 
	With these numbers why would you try when there are thousands of kids applying for the school. We took these numbers into account when looking at the ratings and determined it truly doesn’t matter if you have a better chance of winning the lottery than coming to that school with a low acceptance rate. 
	Then we created a field called Alumni Salary Levels where if a school had a high salary out of School they would be marked with an H, M for middle class, and L for low level. 
	That was noticed that a good chunk of schools had an L(379) level and less had a H(28), but a good mix was in the M(217) bracket. 
	So, we created a described attribute that only looks at the high salary colleges and noticed that 22 of the 28 were private institutions. 
	While you might be seeing this and determined to go to a school where you will be earning a lot of money out of it. 
	This is potentially the case but there’s plenty of out-of-college success stories from those institutions with a M and/or L rating. 
	But there are also many Universities who do great education wise but rely on other outside factors like sports and sponsorship who giver the most money and invest it all back into the college. 
	These colleges are ranked as some of the higher acceptance rated school almost to the point where they exceed capacity and must have many buildings converted to dorms and use of local hotels for rooms.
